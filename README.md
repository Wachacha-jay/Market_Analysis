# Business Analysis

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze and segment businesses based on their purchasing behavior, as well as evaluate product performance. The goal is to classify businesses into distinct value groups, forecast future sales, detect anomalies, and provide actionable insights. Additionally, product analysis will identify which products perform well in the market, understand seasonal trends, and assess the relationship between quantity sold and total revenue generated. Ultimately, these insights will enhance customer engagement, retention, and operational efficiency.

## Background Problem
Understanding customer purchasing behavior is essential for optimizing business strategy and operations. The project addresses the following key questions:

1. How can businesses be segmented based on their purchasing behavior?
2. What are the expected total sales for the next three months for different business segments?
3. Are there any anomalies in purchasing trends, and what factors might contribute to these anomalies?
4. How does the quantity sold relate to the total revenue generated by different products?
5. What strategies can businesses implement to optimize their marketing and operational efforts based on the analysis?
6. How do various products perform in the market, and what insights can be drawn from their sales data?
7. What are the seasonal trends affecting product performance and business sales?
